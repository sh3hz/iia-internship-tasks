# Basic FrontEnd

## Introduction to HTML, CSS, JS

### HTML( Hypertext Markup Language )
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
- As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.
	
### Basic HTML Document Structure
```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>This is document title</title>
		</head>
		
		<body>
			<h1>This is a heading</h1>
			<p>Document content goes here.....</p>
		</body>
	</html>
```
	
### Anatomy of an HTML element

1. Opening Tag
2. Closing Tag
3. Content
4. Element ( with / withoout attributes also)

### Marking up text

- Headings ```<h>```
- Paragraphs ```<p> ```
- Lists ```<ul> <ol> ```
- links ```<a> ```


### CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets )

- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- Superior styles to HTML
- Multiple Device Compatibility
- Global web standards
- With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!


### Anatomy of a CSS ruleset

### Different types of selectors
- Element selector 
- ID selector
- Class selector
- Attribute selector
- Pseudo-class selector

### CSS Box Model 
- CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like: padding, border, margin etc


### JS (JavaScript)
-  Scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
- JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods.
- JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes.

#### JS Types : 

JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Object
	- Function
	- Array
	- Date
	- RegExp
- Symbol
- null
- undefined


JavaScript is a dynamic functional object-oriented programming language that can be used for :


1.Enriching a web page by
- generating browser-specific HTML content or CSS styling,
- inserting dynamic HTML content,
- producing special audio-visual effects (animations).

2. Enriching a web user interface by

- implementing advanced user interface components,
- validating user input on the client side,
- automatically pre-filling certain form fields.

3. Implementing a front-end web application with local or remote data storage, as described in the book Building Front-End Web Apps with Plain JavaScript.

4. Implementing a front-end component for a distributed web application with remote data storage managed by a back-end component, which is a server-side program that is traditionally written in a server-side language such as PHP, Java or C#, but can nowadays also be written in JavaScript with NodeJS.

5. Implementing a complete distributed web application where both the front-end and the back-end components are JavaScript programs.
